### High Performance Video Processing Suite For Autonomous Vehicles
Nishad Gothoskar and Cyrus Tabrizi

### Summary

We are going to build a set of parallel visual-computing tools for doing realtime processing of autonomous vehicle sensor data. The ability to efficiently process multiple streams of RGB and depth data in realtime is critical to the improved safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Our suite will create versions of these algorithms specifically optimized for parallel operation in this compute-constrained environment.

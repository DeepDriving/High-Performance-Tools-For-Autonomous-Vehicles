### High Performance Video Processing Suite For Autonomous Vehicles
Nishad Gothoskar and Cyrus Tabrizi

We are going to build a set of high performance, highly parallel tools for doing realtime data processing primarily to be used to analyze autonomous vehicle data. Many operations for successful automation of vehicles is dependent on realtime analysis.  Our suite will create optimized versions of a variety of analysis algorithms.

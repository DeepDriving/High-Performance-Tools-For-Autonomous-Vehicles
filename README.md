### High Performance Video Processing Suite For Autonomous Vehicles
Nishad Gothoskar and Cyrus Tabrizi


## Summary
We are going to build a set of parallel visual-computing tools for doing realtime processing of autonomous vehicle sensor data. The ability to efficiently process multiple streams of RGB and depth data in realtime is critical to the improved safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Our suite will create versions of these algorithms specifically optimized for parallel operation in this compute-constrained environment.


## Backround
Autonomous vehicle sensors provide primarily spacial data like 360 depth data and video feeds.  The analysis of spacial data for operations like edge detection and optical flow as well as much of the preprocessing of this data before its fed into ML algorithms are highly parallelizable processes. Our project is to take advantage of this parallelism to improve the algorithms with regards to the important constraints of autonomous vehicles: cost, speed, ...

The main set of algorithms we hope to work on are:

 - Optical Flow:

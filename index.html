# Proposal

## Summary
We are going to build a set of parallel visual-computing tools for doing realtime processing of autonomous vehicle sensor data. The ability to efficiently process multiple streams of video and depth data in real-time is critical to the improved safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Our suite will create versions of these algorithms specifically optimized for parallel operation in this compute-constrained environment.

## Backround
Autonomous vehicles use a number of RGB cameras and depth sensors to perceive the world around them. To make sense of all this data, a vehicleâ€™s onboard computer passes each stream of sensor data through a real-time processing pipeline com
